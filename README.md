# Q-rator

Q-rator is an R lang. script that automates creation of files for FlexQTL and other genetic datasets, written for R version 4.0.5+. It requires several input files (which must be converted to comma-separated value files before running) and creates several output files. This is the package required to run the script and UI located [here](https://github.com/mei-sean-chen/Q-rator-UI).

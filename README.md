# Q-rator

Q-rator is an R lang. script that automates creation of files for FlexQTL and other genetic datasets, written for R version 4.0.5+. It requires several input files (which must be converted to comma-separated value files before running) and creates several output files, which we will enumerate below.  

##Setup
Aside from updating to the latest version of R, Q-rator requires the packages tibble, shiny, shinyFiles, devtools, roxygen2, and of course, the Q-rator package. Install these packages first with the following code: 

```
{
install.packages("shiny") 
install.packages("devtools") 
install.packages("roxygen2") 
install.packages("tibble") 
}







```
